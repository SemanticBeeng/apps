# Aecor Apps

## Example using Aecor in an Akka Cluster deployment

 * #todo document architecture & deployment.

## Combine with Baker/Kagera

 [Baker](https://github.com/ing-bank/baker)
  * _" reduces the effort to orchestrate (micro)service-based process flows"_
  * _"Developers declare the orchestration logic in a recipe."_

 [Kagera](https://github.com/nikolakasev/kagera)
 * _"functions acting on the data in the tokens."_
 * _"An event sourcing function which updates the state using the emitted event / output object."_

## Implement distributed data ingestion with Spark/Hoodie

 * #todo Show how `Spark job server` and `Mist` are not the best paradigm (not _"process flows"_)
